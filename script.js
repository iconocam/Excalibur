    // The most straightforward way to loop through an object's properties is by using the for...in statement. This method works in all modern and old browsers including Internet Explorer 6 and higher. One problem in using the for...in method is that it loops through the properties in the prototype chain as well.

/**
 * 

You can access properties like adventurer.name or adventurer.inventory[0].
You can access properties within the nested objects, for example, adventurer.companion.name or adventurer.companion.subCompanion.faceOne.
You can call the roll method like this: adventurer.roll(). If you want to add a modifier, you can pass it as an argument, like adventurer.roll(2).
